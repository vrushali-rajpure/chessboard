Chessboard: <br/>
The chessboard is an 8 x 8 grid with 64 cells in it. <br/>
With 8 rows (A, B, C.... H) and 8 columns (1, 2, 3.... 8), each cell can be uniquely <br/>
identified with its cell number. This can be seen illustrated below. <br/>

A8 B8 C8 D8 E8 F8 G8 H8 <br/>
A7 B7 C7 D7 E7 F7 G7 H7 <br/>
A6 B6 C6 D6 E6 F6 G6 H6 <br/>
A5 B5 C5 D5 E5 F5 G5 H5 <br/>
A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 F4 G4 H4 <br/>
A3 B3 C3 D3 E3 F3 G3 H3 <br/>
A2 B2 C2 D2 E2 F2 G2 H2 <br/>
A1 B1 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 H1 <br/>

Chess pieces and their movements: <br/>
The game of chess has 6 unique types of pieces, with their own unique types
of movements. These are: <br/>
1.) King – Can move only 1 step at a time in all 8 directions (horizontal, vertical
and diagonal) <br/>
2.) Queen – Can move across the board in all 8 directions <br/>
3.) Bishop – Can move across the board only diagonally <br/>
4.) Horse – Can move across the board only in 2.5 steps (2 vertical steps and 1
horizontal step) <br/>
5.) Rook – Can move across the board only vertically and horizontally <br/>
6.) Pawn – Can move only 1 step at a time, in the forward direction, vertically. <br/>
Can also move 1 step forward diagonally, in order to eliminate an opposing
piece. <br/>

Objective of your program: <br/>
Your program should simulate the movement of each unique chess piece on an
empty chessboard. <br/>
• Input – The input string to your program will be the Type of chess piece and
its Position (cell number) on the chessboard. E.g. “King D5” <br/>
• Output – Once you execute the program, the output will be a string of all
possible cells in which the chess piece can move. <br/>
